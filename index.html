                    <p>Our approach to all programs, from strategy and innovation to development and implementation, is to bring human centered design processes and thinking to every opportunity. </p>
                    <p>The result of Presence’s approach is our differentiation: clear paths leading to clear decisions, resulting in real products and services vetted through rapid ideation, prototyping, validation, development, and implementation.</p>
                    <p>Ours is a collaborative and iterative approach. We work closely with our clients, applying our multidisciplinary teams to meet client needs. This approach extends beyond a client relationship philosophy, and can be applied to team working models and project execution.

            <h1 class="sectitle">Strategy &amp; Innovation</h1>
            <p>We believe that true innovation is formed through the combination of business goals/objectives and brand strategy, leading to a plan of action that drives tech R&D, experience explorations and prototyping, implementation of repeatable processes, team structures, and guides investment and partnerships in identified markets.
            </p>
            <p>We bring human centered design principles to all phases of product strategy and innovation. The results are environments and processes that foster innovative ideation, filters and gates driven by market and experience opportunities, validation of ideas through concepting, rapid prototyping, testing, and execution -- resulting in bringing ideas to market.
            </p>
            <p>We realize innovation through the definition, design, and development of software, services and hardware, by applying multidisciplinary teams working across mobile, tablet, web, wearable, TV, and nascent environments.

            <p>Social Impact is our practice focused on building solutions and software tools for nonprofit and B Corp clients. We believe all organizations should have access to great technology -- especially those working on some of the world’s toughest problems: poverty, education, equality, and the environment.
            </p>
            <!-- <p class="lead">Our Experience</p> -->
             <p>We believe that successful projects are the result of not only great work product, but also an exceptional working experience. We are experts in analyzing nonprofit business processes and leveraging technology to make positive changes in efficiency and scalability. Whether you’re a small NGO looking to scale up your operation, or a large enterprise nonprofit looking to refine and redefine how you work, we can help you. We have worked with, and understand in great depth, many nonprofit programs and business models -- in education, human services, social entrepreneurship, and many others.</p>
             <p>Our staff has expertise building some of the most impactful projects in the nonprofit sector: an application and certification system for B Corps, an employee giving platform for Cisco, and a common financial aid application for independent private K-12 schools in the U.S. Whatever you’re seeking to build, we can help you build it.</p>
